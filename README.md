Please find two analysis scripts which aim to characterize and analyze cyclical ecological responses using time series methods. Our framework is based on three approaches: spectral analysis, magnitude squared coherence, and principal component analysis. 
We provide examples of how to implement our framework using (i) a simulated example and (ii) real world data in the form of soundscape data from tropical forests in Gabon. Data is available for download at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xpnvx0kn6 

Please reference the manuscript for more information.
